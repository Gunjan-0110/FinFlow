Finflow is a dynamic web application designed to provide a comprehensive solution for personal financial management. It offers an intuitive platform for users to track income and expenses, set and monitor budgets, and visualize their financial data through an interactive dashboard. This project was developed as the capstone project for my Web Development Summer Internship.

## üöÄ Core Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system to protect personal financial data.

* **Interactive Dashboard:** An at-a-glance summary of total income, expenses, and net balance. Includes dynamic charts for yearly/monthly trends and a pie chart for spending breakdowns by category.

* **Transaction Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for both income and expense records. Transactions can be filtered and sorted for easy viewing.

* **Budgeting Tools:** Users can set, update, and track monthly budgets for various categories. The system provides real-time progress bars and alerts when spending exceeds the set limits.

* **Financial Reporting:** Generate detailed financial reports for custom time periods. Users can visualize spending patterns and download their transaction data as a CSV file for offline analysis.
